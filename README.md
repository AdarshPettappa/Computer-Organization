# Low-Level Programming and Computer Architecture

I engaged in projects that bridge the gap between high-level programming and hardware design. Unlike high-level languages such as C++ that abstract away the underlying hardware, this course emphasizes the understanding of how low-level languages are executed and how the hardware itself performs operations. The projects I worked on are designed to help you understand how computers carry out tasks, focusing on the hardware-software interaction from a deeper perspective.

### Technical Skills Developed:
- **Hardware Description:** Learn how to describe and design hardware components using **diagrams** and **finite-state machines**.
- **Low-Level Programming:** Develop programs using **Assembly language** to interface directly with hardware.
- **Simulation and Testing:** Use **C programming** to simulate hardware designs and test the interactions between different components of a computer.
- **Understanding Hardware Components:** Gain hands-on experience with building blocks like registers, memory, ALUs, and control units, and see how these interact in a working computer system.

## Learning Objectives Achieved:
- **Basic Understanding of Program Execution:** understood how low-level programs are executed on hardware, bridging the gap between high-level languages and actual hardware behavior.
- **Design and Simulation of Hardware:** I am able to describe hardware components in detail, design them using diagrams, and simulate their operations using hardware simulators.
- **Low-Level Programming Skills:** Developed practical skills in Assembly language, enabling you to interact with the hardware and understand how instructions are processed at the machine level.
